Alright now what.
see here <- Chess master <- that means that you're in the main branch
oK
now, if you make any changes you'll need to :
1.to pull the main branch (master) so behind your stuff there's the latest and greatest version
2.commit to your changes, give them a name,
3. Push - merge it with the master branch (ma ze omer?!) (it means that if now you and Danielle made
changes on the same file, and Danielle pushed before you did, you'll have to make sure there are no collisions
with Danielle changes, and if there are change you'll need to decide which version do you keep.
this way, both of you can work in parallel and keep the code saef from BUGGGGS

it is inportant that from now on you do whatever you do on the Git folder. OK?
yes

now, once we see that its a good environement for you, you'll help her have the same :)

alright, enough with talking, lets see what happened with the changes we did,
so first, cntrl+S to get rid of the (*)
now lets go to git
see that we have added some Sh**? (the + at the beggining of lines) yes ok

lets commit to those changes

now, to finalize this tutorial, Im asking from Danielle
